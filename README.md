Project Plan: The Workshop Website

The Problem

My projects, code, and 3D models are scattered all over the place—GitHub, Thingiverse, random hard drives. It's a mess. There's no single place for people to see what I've built, buy the detailed plans, or hire me for a project.

The Solution

One website to rule them all. It's a central hub that does three simple things:

    Show my work (the free stuff).

    Sell my products (the paid blueprints and roadmaps).

    Offer my services (the "hire me" page).

It needs to be simple, fast, and easy for me to update.

What It Actually Does

The site is broken into three tiers. No "invocations," just features.

Tier 1: Free Stuff (The Portfolio)

This is where I prove I know what I'm doing. It’s the hook.

    Project Gallery: A simple, clean gallery of my projects (robots, bots, etc.). Each project gets a page with:

        A good picture or video.

        The public README file.

        Links to the free code or 3D models.

        A big, obvious button that says "Buy the Full Guide."

    My Blog: A journal where I'll post project updates, explain how I solved a problem, or share code snippets. No philosophical ramblings, just practical posts about building things.

Tier 2: Paid Stuff (The Blueprints)

This is the store. It's where I sell the in-depth knowledge that takes real time to produce.

    Premium Roadmaps: For the big projects (Johnny 5, Ender 5 mods), people can buy a complete, step-by-step guide. This is a zip file with:

        Detailed build instructions.

        Full schematics and commented code.

        The high-res, ready-to-print 3D files.

        My personal notes on why I made certain design choices.

    Blueprint Packs: Smaller, reusable things like collections of 3D models or useful code libraries.

Tier 3: Hire Me (The Day Job)

A simple page for potential clients. No flowery language, just what I can do for them.

    What I Offer: A clear list of services.

        Custom Backend Systems: Building backends that work.

        Hardware Prototyping: Taking an idea and building a physical thing.

        Workflow Automation: Building custom AI tools to make their life easier.

    Contact Form: A form to get the ball rolling. It'll ask for the project details upfront so we don't waste time in meetings.

The Tech Stack

No magic, just tools that work. The code is the proof.

    Frontend: Next.js. It's fast and doesn't mess up SEO.

    Backend: Python/Flask or Node.js. It's simple and I know it well.

    Database: PostgreSQL. It's solid and it scales.

    Payments: Stripe. It handles the money so I don't have to.

    Content: A headless CMS like Strapi. It means I can add blog posts without having to deploy new code.

    Analytics: Plausible. It tracks visitors without being creepy.

The Plan (How We'll Build It)

Perfect is the imaginary friend of never shipped. We'll build this in phases.

    Phase 1: Build the Portfolio. Get the basic site up. Build the project gallery and the blog. Show off all the free stuff. Make it look good and work fast.

    Phase 2: Add the Paywall. Bolt on the Stripe integration. Put the first premium roadmap up for sale. Add the "Hire Me" page. Start making money.

    Phase 3: Add User Accounts. If people are buying things, they'll need user accounts to access their downloads. We'll build that when we need it, not before. Maybe a forum later, if people actually want it.
